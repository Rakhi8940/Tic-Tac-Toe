# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe Game

A classic **Tic Tac Toe** game (also known as Noughts and Crosses) built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This browser-based game allows two players to take turns, keeps track of the game state, and displays the winner or a draw at the end with a polished UI.

- A win (3 in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- A draw (all cells filled with no winner)
- A message is displayed when the game ends.
- The board can be reset using the “Restart” button.
